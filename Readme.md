cd SeleniumAutomation
Running Tests
You can execute tests via the command line using Maven Surefire Plugin. The framework supports the following parameters:

Running tests on LambdaTest:

mvn test -Dbrowser=chrome -DisLambdaTest=true -DisHeadless=false -DisRemote=false -DenvName=QA -X
Running tests on Chrome browser in HeadLess Mode:

mvn test -Dbrowser=chrome -DisLambdaTest=false -DisHeadless=true -DisRemote=false -DenvName=QA -X
Test Reports & Logs
Reports: After execution, a detailed HTML report will be generated at ./report.html
The report contains information on test cases executed pass failed and skipped, along with screenshots for failed tests.
Logs:
Logs are created during the test execution and stored in the ./logs/ directory.

Integrated with Jenkins
